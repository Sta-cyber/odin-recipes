    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There is coconut in this lemon bar recipe, but rest assured it is not a dominant flavor. If you would like, you can also up the amount of zest for a more prominent lemon flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Crust</h3>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup cold butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>
            
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup flaked coconut</li>
        <li> ¼ cup all-purpose flour</li> 
        <li>4 large eggs</li> 
        <li>2 medium lemons, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons powdered sugar, or to taste</li>  
            
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Combine flour, butter, and powdered sugar for crust in a food processor; pulse until fine crumbles form. Press into the prepared pan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake crust in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine sugar, coconut, flour, eggs, lemon zest, lemon juice, and baking powder in a bowl.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove crust from the oven and pour filling over top. Return to the oven and bake until just golden around the edges, 20 to 25 minutes more.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let cool, about 30 minutes. Place in the refrigerator until completely chilled, about 2 hours. Dust with powdered sugar and cut into 24 bars.</li>
    </ol>
